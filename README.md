VTM is an application developed for a Kinect, which my partners and me developed at Yaleâ€™s Hackathon in 36 hours. We won 3rd place from approximately 1000 students that came from all over North America. This App was designed for musical enthusiasts and for people wanting to have fun making music. This was developed in C# using Visual Studio, 3D modeling with AutoCAD, and Animation with Blender.
